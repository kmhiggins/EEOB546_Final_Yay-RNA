## Crisp et al 2020

In this paper the authors sought to investigate the contribution of Small RNAs to heterosis. 
They mapped small RNAs of both hybrid and inbred lines as well as 5 tissues in each and compared them based on size (21 bp,22 bp, 24 bp) to mRNA from the same tissue of the same hybrid/inbred.

In this paper they found that the global abundance of sRNAs varies little between inbreds and hybrids which suggests that sRNA is affected by hybridization at specific loci rather than on a global scale. 

This paper had many well made and challenging figures that we sought to recreate.
